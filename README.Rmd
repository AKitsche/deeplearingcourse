This repository contains R functions to build up deep learning modules in R for training purposes.

This is a step-by-step guide to introduce the fundamental of deep learning using neural networks. 
The content of this repository is highly based on my personal leanings of Andrew Ng's Coursera Deep Learning Specialization course [@deep_learning]. Furthermore the author would refer to the books @GoodBengCour16 and @Chollet2018.
