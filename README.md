This repository contains R functions to build up deep learning modules
in R for training purposes.

This is a step-by-step guide to introduce the fundamental of deep
learning using neural networks. The content of this repository is highly
based on my personal leanings of Andrew Ng’s Coursera Deep Learning
Specialization course (Ng 2020). Furthermore the author would refer to
the books Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (2016) and Chollet and
Allaire (2018).
